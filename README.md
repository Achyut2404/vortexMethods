Solves 2D Incompressible N-S equations, using particle vortex methods. The codes are based on lectures given by Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran at Aerospace Engineering Dept., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

Run a flow around circular cylinder case:
python -c "import tInt; tInt.test4RK2()" 

I am still working on increasing performance of the code, and working with moving arbitary shaped boundaries.
